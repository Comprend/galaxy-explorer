# Help & Reference

[Sociocracy30.org](https://sociocracy30.org/) is a good reference with many more patterns that we can implement when we need to. We don't "have to" do anything, it's always on an as-needed basis.

If you have questions, suggestions or want to talk about space, our facilitator team Galaxy Cats is at your service. Contact [galaxycats@comprend.com](mailto:galaxycats@comprend.com), or who is current operations leader for the cats.

Further reading material: TBD, coming in the next version of this guide.
