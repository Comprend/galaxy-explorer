# Evolution

The journey is never finished! It is Tao â€“ always becoming. We live, act, learn and adapt throughout the journey, becoming ever larger versions of ourselves, individually and together. What we create has the potential to be truly marvelling. We decide, no one else. It all comes down to: How can you be a more authentic and greater version of yourself? How can we work together to create more magic in the world?

The better we become at self-governance, the more likely we are to thrive in this complex and changing environment. We become "anti-fragile", as defined by NN Taleb in the book with the same name. The higher the complexity, the healthier we become. Motivation, well-being, adaptation, customer value and innovation will hopefully grow as a consequence. We will have fulfilled the Voyager project's primary driver.
