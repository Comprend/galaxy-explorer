## Am I allowed to suggest updates to this guide?

Of course! In fact, you are encouraged to do so. It’s a living document and we’re all responsible to keep taking it to the next level. Just forward your suggestion to the team who is responsible, currently the Voyager facilitator team.

The guide is published on Gitbook, with the [Github repository](https://github.com/comprend/galaxy-explorer) as source. Please contact The Galaxy Cats for access to update!
